    <h1>Prakash P S</h1>
    <p><strong>Learning Experience Consultant</strong></p>
    <p>
      I work at the intersection of learning strategy, instructional judgment, and business outcomes.
      My focus is on designing learning solutions that scale, hold quality under pressure,
      and support real performance—not just content delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over 12 years of experience across enterprise environments,
      I lead learning decisions from problem framing through execution,
      balancing speed, quality, and long-term impact.
