      <h2>Learning Experience Consultant</h2>

      <p>
        I work at the intersection of learning strategy, instructional judgment, and
        measurable business outcomes. My focus is on designing learning solutions that
        perform in real-world enterprise conditions where ambiguity is common, timelines
        are compressed, and learning must scale without compromising quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over 13 years of experience across enterprise environments, I lead learning
        decisions from problem framing through execution, partnering with stakeholders
        to balance speed, instructional integrity, cross-functional alignment, and
        long-term sustainability. My work spans digital, blended, and instructor-led
        ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on governance, design standards, and
        decision clarity.
