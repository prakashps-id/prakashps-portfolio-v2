        <p>
          I work at the intersection of learning strategy, instructional judgment,
          and measurable business outcomes. My focus is on designing learning
          solutions that perform in real-world enterprise conditions where
          ambiguity is common, timelines are compressed, and learning must scale
          without compromising quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          With over 13 years of experience across enterprise environments, I lead
          learning decisions from problem framing through execution, partnering
          with stakeholders to balance speed, instructional integrity,
          cross-functional alignment, and long-term sustainability. My work spans
          digital, blended, and instructor-led ecosystems, with a strong emphasis
          on governance, design standards, and decision clarity.
