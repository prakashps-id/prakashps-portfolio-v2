      <h1>Prakash P S</h1>
      <p class="role">Learning Experience Consultant</p>

<p>
  I work at the intersection of learning strategy, instructional judgment, and measurable business outcomes.
  My focus is on designing learning solutions that perform in real-world enterprise conditions where ambiguity is common,
  timelines are compressed, and learning must scale without compromising quality.
</p>

<p>
  With over 13 years of experience across enterprise environments, I lead learning decisions from problem framing through execution,
  partnering with stakeholders to balance speed, instructional integrity, cross-functional alignment, and long-term sustainability.
  My work spans digital, blended, and instructor-led ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on governance, design standards, and decision clarity.
