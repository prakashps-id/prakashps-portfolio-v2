    <h1>How I Think</h1>
    <p>
      This page outlines the principles and decision lenses that guide my work,
      particularly in situations where constraints are high and clarity is limited.

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <p>
      Business clarity before content volume. Learning effectiveness over visual polish.
      Accessibility and scalability are treated as baselines, not enhancements.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>
      I routinely navigate trade-offs between speed and depth, standardization and
      customization, and stakeholder urgency versus learning integrity.

      These principles are reflected across the case studies in this portfolio.
